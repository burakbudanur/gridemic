# Code & Data for reproducing the results of Scarselli et al. (2021)

The notebooks 

- plot_Fig2.ipynb
- plot_Fig3.ipynb
- plot_Fig4.ipynb

produces the main results (Fig. 2--4) of Scarselli et al. (2021). 

The necessary data is readily provided in the folder `data/`. 

If you wish to recreate this data, you would need to edit `generate_data_*` and `submit.script` according to your computing cluster's configuration. Afterwards, running the scripts `generate_*` batch produces the runs that generate simulation `data`.
