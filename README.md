# gridemic

`gridemic` is a python class for stochastic agent-based epidemic models on a square grid with long-range interactions. 

In addition to the disease spread, `gridemic` also simulates the testing & contact tracing  simultaneously. 

The notebooks in `examples/` demonstrates basic functionality of `gridemic`.
